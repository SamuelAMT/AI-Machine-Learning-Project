# 💡 PyTorch Deep Learning Model
This is a trained model, making predictions, and evaluating its performance with test images.
The process involves importing dependencies, setting up data transformations, defining a neural network class, and training the model with backpropagation. <br>

## 🧠 Overview 
PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework commonly used in Python. <br>
Developed by Facebook, PyTorch accelerates the creation of deep learning models and is widely used in research.
